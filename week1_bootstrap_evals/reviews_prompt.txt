Write {n} realistic but detailed / specific product reviews that might show up on a hardware store's website.

The reviews should be about the following product:
Product Title: {product.title}
Product Description: {product.description}

Add many relevant and concrete facts about the products (this is for synthetic data generation, make up facts about each product as necessary).

To illustrate the format of a typical review, here's a review for a saw:
```
I've enjoyed using this saw. It is lightweight and the battery lasts longer than other brands.
I've been using it for 3 years now and it has been very durable. It was twice as expensive as the PX-500. But
it is comfortable to hold because of the light weight.
```

Respond only with the reviews, and nothing else.
